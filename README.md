# WebDiscoRImplementation

!!! This repository contains all files used to develop the distributed Cox model method. It is not the final product. Go to the repository "Distrib_survival_analysis" for that. !!!

WebDISCO algorithm implemented in R

Folder "Distributed Cox model (WebDISCO)" contains files for distributed Cox model, with global server and local sites. Read Instructions pour utilisation du code before usage.

File "Cox model WebDISCO (one file)" is the whole process executed in a single file. It is way less flexible, but easy to see the progression and steps of the algorithm. Not recommended for use.
