# WebDiscoRImplementation
WebDISCO algorithm implemented in R

Folder "Distributed Cox model (WebDISCO)" contains files for distributed Cox model, with global server and local sites.

File "Cox model WebDISCO (one file)" is the whole process executed in a single file. It is way less flexible, but easy to see the progression and steps of the algorithm. Not recommended for use.
