Instructions to run the code:

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to initialize local times.
- Run the file Global_server.R to initialize global times.

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to initialize parameters (Dik, Rik, sumZr).
- Run the file Global_server.R to initialize sum of Zr and beta.

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to do an iteration.
- Run the file Global_server.R to calculate a new beta.
- Repeat both steps to do more iterations.

To start over, it is important to delete all "output" files.

Ajust the number of files "Local_site_call_x.R" depending on number of sites, and make sure to change the value of manualk to the number of the site.

The number of betas to calculate should be written at the header of all local files and global server.

Important notes:
0 = censored
1 = event

(Can be changed in files Local_site_core_times and Local_site_core_params if not the case, simply change node_data$status == 1 and put it equal to the value of event)

The two first column must be named "time" and "status" (order not important)

Works only with complete data (incomplete data with NA values will not make the code crash, but will induce calculation errors)
