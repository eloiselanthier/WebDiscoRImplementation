Comment utiliser le code:

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to initialize local times.
- Run the file Global_server.R to initialize global times.

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to initialize parameters (Dik, Rik).
- Run the file Global_server.R to initialize sum of Zr and beta.

- Run the files Local_site_call_x.R (for all x) to do a first iteration.
- Run the file Global_server.R to calculate new beta.

Repeat the last process in a loop to converge eventually.

To start over, it is important to delete all "output" files.

Ajust the number of files depending on number of sites and number of betas to calculate.
Number of betas to calculate should be written at the header of all local files and global server.
